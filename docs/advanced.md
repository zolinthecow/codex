## Non-interactive / CI mode

Run Codex head-less in pipelines. Example GitHub Action step:

```yaml
- name: Update changelog via Codex
  run: |
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    codex login --api-key "${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}"
    codex exec --full-auto "update CHANGELOG for next release"
```

## Tracing / verbose logging

Because Codex is written in Rust, it honors the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to configure its logging behavior.

The TUI defaults to `RUST_LOG=codex_core=info,codex_tui=info` and log messages are written to `~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log`, so you can leave the following running in a separate terminal to monitor log messages as they are written:

```
tail -F ~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log
```

By comparison, the non-interactive mode (`codex exec`) defaults to `RUST_LOG=error`, but messages are printed inline, so there is no need to monitor a separate file.

See the Rust documentation on [`RUST_LOG`](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging) for more information on the configuration options.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Codex CLI can be configured to leverage MCP servers by defining an [`mcp_servers`](./config.md#mcp_servers) section in `~/.codex/config.toml`. It is intended to mirror how tools such as Claude and Cursor define `mcpServers` in their respective JSON config files, though the Codex format is slightly different since it uses TOML rather than JSON, e.g.:

```toml
# IMPORTANT: the top-level key is `mcp_servers` rather than `mcpServers`.
[mcp_servers.server-name]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "mcp-server"]
env = { "API_KEY" = "value" }
```

> [!TIP]
> It is somewhat experimental, but the Codex CLI can also be run as an MCP _server_ via `codex mcp`. If you launch it with an MCP client such as `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector codex mcp` and send it a `tools/list` request, you will see that there is only one tool, `codex`, that accepts a grab-bag of inputs, including a catch-all `config` map for anything you might want to override. Feel free to play around with it and provide feedback via GitHub issues.
